          plants, a unique selection of healthy tropical fish, quality supplies
          and the inspiration to get you excited about keeping aquariums again.

          Our focus is on the Nature Aquarium style of freshwater aquarium
          design. Nature Aquariums combine aquatic plants with artistically
          designed layouts of wood and stone to create a beautiful ecosystem in
          miniature. We take pride in giving our customers excellent customer
          service and have over 30 years of experience to draw from.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its heart, Aquarium Zen is an independent, small business, tropical
          fish store and we can serve the basic needs of most freshwater
          aquarium owners, even if the Nature Aquarium is not your style. Our
          goal is to mentor our clients in creating the aquarium of their
          dreams.

          The Nature Aquarium style originated in Japan and was pioneered by
          aquarist and landscape photographer, Takashi Amano. Mr. Amano combined
          his many years of nature study and cultural background of refined
          Japanese aesthetics to create an aquarium design that resonates with
          natural energy and artistic expression. A Nature Aquarium is an art
          form and a living ecosystem. Nature Aquariums combine stylish aquarium
          equipment with layouts of wood, stone, living plants and fish to
          create an enchantment that is not soon forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aquarium Zen is one of the few tropical fish stores in the world
          focused on the Nature Aquarium style. Our showroom in Seattle has all
          the supplies, equipment and knowledge necessary to help you create and
          maintain one of these living pieces of art in your own home or office.

          We have a "hardscape dojo" where you can work out your hardscape
          design of wood and stone in a relaxed and fun manner, before you
          purchase it. We have a diverse and varied selection of rimless glass
          aquariums, the ideal vessel for artistic aquarium creations. Our
          shelves are stocked with unique equipment and supplies selected for
          their durability and ability to provide the right conditions to keep
          your planted freshwater aquarium alive and healthy. Aquarium Zen is an
          official retailer of Aqua Design Amano (ADA) products, the premier
          Japanese supplier of Nature Aquarium supplies. If you appreciate
          aquariums, a trip to Aquarium Zen will be a memorable experience.

          Many of our customers have described Aquarium Zen as a tropical oasis
          filled with life in a space graced with natural light, old Seattle
          charm, warmth and beauty.
